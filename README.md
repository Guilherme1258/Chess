# Chess
 
To run the game, simply clone the code and execute the command `dotnet run`.

The board is an 8x8 grid where rows are represented by letters from 'A' to 'H' and columns by numbers from 1 to 8. Therefore, you need letter and number combinations to select each square, such as B2, C3, H8, etc. (Upper and lower case letters are not distinguished).

Currently, only the Player vs. Player mode has been implemented. To play, just type the position of the piece you want to move and the position on the board where you want to move it. The game will indicate if the move is allowed and which squares are possible destinations.
